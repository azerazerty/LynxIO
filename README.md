# LynxIO
LynxIO is an open source project Built on top of `SocketIO` and `PeerJs`
## Description:
The project aims to create an open-source library that combines the ease of Socket.io for signaling with the power of PeerJS for WebRTC peer-to-peer connections. This library will enable developers to set up multi-user, real-time group chat applications with minimal configuration. By automating signaling, peer connections, event handling, and message broadcasting, this library will simplify the process of building WebRTC-based group chats.

## Goals:
- Provide a straightforward API for creating and joining rooms, establishing peer connections, and handling real-time messaging.
- Support built-in room management, connection stability, and automatic reconnections.
- Allow seamless integration with existing Node.js applications, leveraging both Socket.io and WebRTC for scalable and secure communication.
## Looking for Contributors: 
We’re seeking full-stack Node.js developers passionate about real-time communication, WebRTC, and open-source collaboration. Contributors will have the opportunity to:

- Work with WebRTC, PeerJS, and Socket.io to build a cutting-edge group chat solution.
- Design APIs, optimize data channels, and create modular components for flexible use.
- Develop documentation and examples for an engaging developer experience.
If you’re excited about contributing to a library that empowers developers to create rich, real-time communication experiences, let’s connect!
